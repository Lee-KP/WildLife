                    <h3>RHINO-BEETLES</h3>
                    <p>With powerful horns and a shiny armored shell, rhino beetles might look fierce — but they’re completely harmless to humans. Named for the large horn-like structures on the males’ heads, these beetles use their impressive strength to dig, climb, and compete with rivals (not to attack!).</p>
                    <p>Despite their tough appearance, rhino beetles are surprisingly gentle. They feed mostly on fruit, nectar, and tree sap, playing an important role in forest ecosystems. Some species are strong enough to lift objects up to 850 times their own weight — making them some of the strongest creatures on Earth for their size.</p>

                    <p>Rhino beetles are found in tropical and subtropical forests around the world, especially in Southeast Asia, Central and South America, and parts of Africa. They spend much of their lives underground as larvae before emerging as adults</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
