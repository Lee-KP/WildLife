                    <h3>TIGERS</h3>
                   

                    <p>The tiger is the largest species of cat in the world — a true jungle giant known for its iconic stripes, silent footsteps, and unmatched power. Despite their strength and reputation as apex predators, tigers are solitary and surprisingly elusive, preferring to move quietly through forests and grasslands.</p>
                    <p>Tigers are carnivores, feeding on large prey such as deer and wild boar. A single tiger’s territory can span hundreds of square kilometers, depending on prey availability and habitat. Each tiger’s stripe pattern is unique, much like a human fingerprint.</p>

                    <p>Native to parts of Asia, tigers once roamed across much of the continent, but today they are found in fragmented populations across India, Southeast Asia, and the Russian Far East. Due to habitat loss, poaching, and human conflict, they are listed as endangered, with fewer than 4,000 individuals left in the wild.</p>
